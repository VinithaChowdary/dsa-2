The Mapp3D project focuses on creating a real-time 3D mapping and geolocation tracking system using IoT devices and GPS sensors. By leveraging ESP8266 WiFi modules and NodeMCU microcontrollers, the system collects vital data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, and timestamps. This data is transmitted to a central server for storage and processing, which then displays the information on an interactive dashboard via the Arduino IoT Cloud. The user-friendly dashboard allows dynamic visualization and interaction with the map, where each button press updates the map with real-time coordinates in JSON format. The system supports additional functionalities like updating node information, finding the shortest path using the A* algorithm, and displaying 3D graphs. The use of Haversine's formula and the Pythagorean theorem ensures high accuracy in distance calculations between nodes.

The project's real-world applications are vast, ranging from asset tracking and logistics optimization to environmental monitoring. The system can continuously monitor the location, altitude, and time data of each tracked object and send this information to a central server for real-time analysis. The inclusion of a pathfinding algorithm allows for the efficient planning of routes, considering geographical distances and altitude changes. This technology's versatility extends to various industries, including urban planning, disaster response, and logistics management. The integration of geolocation data, sophisticated algorithms, and immersive 3D visualization capabilities highlights the potential of IoT in enhancing spatial intelligence and monitoring【15:0†source】【15:1†source】【15:2†source】【15:3†source】【15:4†source】【15:5†source】.
